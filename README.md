#  About Me:

Not gonna put AI slop in here, so here's a brief wall of text about me.

Almost done with engineering life. Finally broke into big tech after months of gruelling job hunting.

I'm primarily a full-stack developer. Curious about where AI is headed. My bet? Small LLMs are the future.

I talk like I’m joking 95% of the time, but the remaining 5% I’m dead serious… sometimes even I can’t tell which is which. If something is working perfectly, I’ll still open it to understand why it’s working perfectly. My brain’s peak hours are 1AM to 4AM. Productivity? No. Random curiosity rabbit holes? Absolutely yes.

I'll look into Spring Boot and system design when I get the time. I'm prioritising my mental and physical health more. My hairline has gone back a kilometer already. I still cannot believe that despite the burnout, my memory power is inhuman. I can remember what I've eaten, at what time, in what place, and entire conversations that happened 10 years ago like nothing. The more I think about it, the more this curse is terrifying.

I LOVE researching things. If I notice one symptom, I’ll spend two hours researching it like I'm preparing to publish a journal paper. Give me a topic and one night, I’ll show up the next day talking like I’ve worked 5 years in that domain. A small unanswered question can haunt me for days.

New tech stack? I MUST KNOW IT IN AND OUT.

A visit to the orthodontist? I SHALL KNOW EVERY TERM THE DOC MENTIONED IN THE VISIT.

I notice hair loss? I MUST KNOW EVERY TREATMENT OUT THERE TO MAKE IT GROW BACK LIKE CRETACEOUS-ERA FORESTS.

I love experimenting with things too. Don't be surprised when I mix pickled paprika with curd rice. I'm weird. I embrace my craziness.

Known in my social circle as the walking encyclopedia of technology.

PC, phone, or any other device with silicon that has problems in it? Tech purchase suggestions? Tech stack roadmap? Insights into anything regarding technology? The first guy people think of is me.

To my juniors reading this: either you crack DSA or DSA will crack you. Start now.
