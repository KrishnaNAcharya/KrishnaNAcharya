#  About Me:
Not gonna put AI slop in here so here's a brief wall of text about me.

Almost done with engineering life. Finally broke into big tech after months of gruelling job hunt.

I'm primarily a full stack developer. Curious about where AI is headed. My bet? Small LLMs are the future.

I'll look into SpringBoot and system design when I get the time. I'm prioritising my mental and physical health more. My hairline has gone back a kilometer already.

I LOVE researching things. 
New tech stack? I MUST KNOW IN AND OUT OF IT.
A visit to the orthodontist? I SHALL KNOW EVERY TERM THE DOC HAD MENTIONED IN THE VISIT.
I notice hair loss? I MUST KNOW EVERY TREATMENT OUT THERE TO MAKE IT GROW BACK LIKE CRETACEOUS ERA FORESTS.

I love experiementing things too. Don't be surprised when I mix pickled paprika to curd rice. I'm weird.

I embrace my craziness.
